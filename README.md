### Goldsmiths PhD Thesis Template ###

This is a hastily stripped down version of my PhD dissertation LaTeX
document (which was generated from org-mode…), in the hope it might be
useful for others looking to format similar documents vaguely
conformant to Goldsmiths, University of London guidelines.

Something like the [UCL
template](https://github.com/UCL/ucl-latex-thesis-templates) may be a
better approach.

Some ideas here were taken from Dan Stowell’s (Queen Mary University
of London)
[thesis](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/queen-mary-university-of-london/fwfyjjkcswpw#.Wcp04HVSxhE).
